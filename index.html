  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps my fondest memory in all my time spent coding was the all-out dash to build a complex PHP web-app for my undergrad dissertation. It was the biggest project I&rsquo;d ever attempted, and was the starting-gun I&rsquo;d been waiting for, the opportunity to really dig into something.</p>

<p>Man, I was so psyched about my idea &ndash; it was a web-scraper named Gigsniffr which aggregated a set of concert ticket websites. The killer feature was that when it saw a ticket come onsale for a user&rsquo;s favourite band, it alerted them via a tweet (back when Twitter was still conceived of as a computer-human API platform). At the time, nothing much like this yet existed (2007 was also when <a href="http://songkick.com/">Songkick</a> launched), and I knew for sure that it could be big if I could <em>just</em> get it launched.</p>

<p>This was before any of these music sites had a published API for me to use, so I had to really research how to put together a reliable web-scraping algorithm that could repeatedly spider the ticket sites.</p>

<p>The project was incredibly fun: I was developing into (for me) the complete unknown &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t amazing at PHP, I had no experience of managing a long-running web-scraper service, I had no permission to scrape these sites, I had a hard deadline to hit, and nothing to distract me.</p>

<p>There were many problems to solve: how can you work out the names of a user&rsquo;s nearest cities, without Google&rsquo;s Map API; how do you build an engine to accurately scrape many different websites, abstracting away from the quirks of each (answer: invent own XPath tricks); how do you diff the data collected with that taken an hour previously?</p>

<p>I soon found that the first pass of data gathering was easy &ndash;  but updating and correcting this dataset was actually much harder: I was attempting to keep track of gig cancellations, date changes, and variances in band names (Red Hot Chili Peppers vs RHCP etc), and it was a rathole without end. Much fun to solve!</p>

<p>I did manage to get a prototype working in time for the deadline &ndash; an achievement which to this day I&rsquo;m proud of. At the presentation were two local entrepreneurs who took an interest in my idea and took me out for lunch to discuss it.</p>

<p>Alas &ndash; I ground to a halt somewhere between finishing the proof-of-concept and launching a user-ready product.  After I&rsquo;d delivered the proof-of-concept and completed the course, the pressure was off and it was time to relax &ndash; I&rsquo;d hit the deadline and could now continue developing Gigsniffr at my leisure, right after I&rsquo;ve been to these music festivals and learned Ruby and started a job and&hellip;</p>

<p>.. and it was gradually forgotten. The would-be investors were interested only in funding marketing, and only once the app was finished &ndash; they were not interested in financing even the peanuts I&rsquo;d need to sit down and complete it. I was also messed up after a nasty breakup. I found myself in a job that absorbed 10 hours of coding stamina per day, which I then quit to take a Masters &ndash; without any real gap after the undergrad. If I&rsquo;m honest, I&rsquo;d got what I wanted from the project, and was moving on &ndash; so Gigsniffr was shelved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve a profound admiration for those running startups which actually launch, especially those who succeed longterm &ndash; it&rsquo;s an amazing feat. People say that ideas are cheap, and that building them is the hard bit. What they don&rsquo;t mention is that building the interesting parts of a project is pretty easy, but FINISHING it is nearly impossible in comparison. Finishing a product really is hard. But the burst of real energy and creativity I summoned for Gigsniffr is something I&rsquo;ve been chasing ever since.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s an app that I&rsquo;ve been working on in my spare time, which I&rsquo;ve actually been using personally for several months, but which I&rsquo;ve not managed to pat together into an App store release.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple app based on something I needed each time I found myself in a new city when I was travelling: when you arrive, you constantly see lots of places you&rsquo;d like to return to, and it would be super handy if you could just drop a pin there, add a short title and thus remember it for later. After a while, you&rsquo;ll see a map studded with interesting places that you yourself have added, and it&rsquo;s simple to find your way back later on.  When you go to the next city, you start a new map, etc.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/soffes">Sam Soffes</a> talking passionately about developing <a href="https://github.com/nothingmagical/cheddar-ios">Cheddar</a> on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/38">Founders Talk</a> podcast, I&rsquo;m going to <a href="https://github.com/tacksapp/tacksapp">open-source</a> this app and blog about its development too.</p>
